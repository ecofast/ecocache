# ecocache
Ecocache is a groupcache/redis/memcached like key/value cache store, intended to be used in specific cases.</br>
It's inspired by google's [groupcache](https://github.com/golang/groupcache) project and actually, some of ecocache's core code were "copyed" from groupcache.</br>

**Note that this is still early alpha code and needs further development / bug-fix in many place.**
